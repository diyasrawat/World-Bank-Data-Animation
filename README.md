# World-Bank-Data-Animation
This project recreates the insightful animated data visualization that Hans Rosling presented in his famous 2006 TED talk "The best stats you've ever seen." The animation debunked several misconceptions about global health by illustrating the evolution of life expectancy, fertility rate, and population across different world regions from 1960-2016.
