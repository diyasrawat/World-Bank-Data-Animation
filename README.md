# World-Bank-Data-Animation
This project recreates the insightful animated data visualization that Hans Rosling presented in his famous 2006 TED talk "The best stats you've ever seen." The animation debunked several misconceptions about global health by illustrating the evolution of life expectancy, fertility rate, and population across different world regions from 1960-2016.

The goal is to retrieve, clean, and visualize updated World Bank data to produce a clone of Rosling's animation using Python tools like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The tasks involve:

Loading 3 datasets from the World Bank data catalog on life expectancy, fertility rate, and population
Preprocessing the data - handling missing values, checking data types, merging dataframes
Generating exploratory visualizations including population trends over time, fertility rate distribution, changes in life expectancy, correlation analysis, and regional comparisons
Animating an interactive graph mapping life expectancy, fertility rate, and population changes by region from 1960-2016
This project allows you to apply core Python data analysis skills while reproducing an iconic data visualization that had a major impact in correcting prevailing misconceptions about global development at the time. The hands-on work involves gathering insights from multiple datasets, wrangling and transforming data, and presenting compelling animated data stories.
